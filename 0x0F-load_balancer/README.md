0x0F. Load balancer

Two addittional servers comprising:

gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX

These servers are to improve the web stack so that there is redundancy
for the web server.This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic
by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure
more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one
to handle requests.

For this project, Bash scripts is needed to be written
to automate the work. All scripts must be designed to
configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task
requirements.
